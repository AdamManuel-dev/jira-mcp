# Product Requirements Document: JIRA Sprint Alert AI Agent

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Product Name:** Sprint Intelligence Alert System (SIAS)  
**Document Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Sprint Intelligence Alert System (SIAS) is an AI-powered monitoring agent that analyzes JIRA sprint data in real-time to identify potential risks, bottlenecks, and opportunities for optimization. The system proactively alerts team members about critical sprint health indicators through intelligent notifications accompanied by visual insights, enabling teams to maintain sprint velocity and improve delivery predictability.

## 2. Problem Statement

Development teams frequently miss critical sprint issues until it's too late to course-correct:
- **Incomplete ticket information** leads to estimation errors and blocked work
- **Lack of visibility** into sprint progress causes surprises at sprint end
- **Manual monitoring** is time-consuming and often overlooked
- **Delayed responses** to comments and blockers impact team velocity
- **Missing development artifacts** (code, PRs) aren't discovered until sprint review

These issues result in:
- 25-30% of sprints failing to meet commitments
- Increased technical debt from rushed last-minute work
- Team burnout from constant firefighting
- Reduced stakeholder confidence in delivery predictions

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Proactive Risk Detection**: Identify sprint risks before they become blockers
2. **Automated Monitoring**: Eliminate manual sprint health checks
3. **Visual Intelligence**: Provide clear, actionable insights with every alert
4. **Response Time Improvement**: Reduce average response time to blockers by 70%

### Measurable Objectives
- Increase sprint completion rate from 70% to 90%
- Reduce average ticket cycle time by 30%
- Achieve 95% detection rate for missing artifacts
- Decrease unplanned work by 40%
- Improve estimation accuracy to Â±15%

## 12. Risks & Dependencies

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| JIRA API rate limits | High | Medium | Implement caching and batch processing |
| Git integration complexity | Medium | High | Support major providers first, others later |
| Alert fatigue | High | Medium | Smart batching and customization |
| Visualization performance | Medium | Low | Pre-generate common charts |

### Dependencies
- **JIRA Cloud/Server**: API availability and permissions
- **Git Providers**: API access and webhook support
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud hosting and scaling capabilities
- **ML Models**: Training data for predictive features

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Core features work without all integrations
2. **Caching Strategy**: Reduce API calls through intelligent caching
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add intelligence incrementally
4. **Feedback Loops**: Continuous tuning based on user feedback

## 13. Out of Scope

### Current Phase Exclusions
- Integration with project management tools other than JIRA
- Custom machine learning model training interface
- Automated ticket creation or modification
- Team performance reviews or individual scoring
- Integration with HR systems
- Real-time video/audio alerts
- Blockchain integration for audit trails

### Future Considerations
These features may be considered for future releases:
- Azure DevOps and Rally integration
- Custom ML model fine-tuning interface
- Automated ticket resolution for simple issues
- Integration with code quality tools (SonarQube, etc.)
- Predictive bug detection
- Automated sprint retrospective insights
- Team sentiment analysis from communication patterns

```

### B. Sample Visualizations

1. **Sprint Health Dashboard**
   - Overall health score gauge (0-100)
   - Risk indicators by category
   - Team member workload distribution
   - Velocity trend with prediction

2. **Alert Context Chart**
   - Time remaining vs work remaining
   - Burn-down actual vs ideal
   - Blocker aging histogram
   - Team capacity utilization

### C. Integration Mappings

```javascript
// JIRA Field Mappings
const fieldMappings = {
  storyPoints: ['customfield_10001', 'Story Points'],
  timeEstimate: ['timeoriginalestimate', 'Original Estimate'],
  timeLogged: ['timespent', 'Time Spent'],
  sprint: ['customfield_10002', 'Sprint'],
  epicLink: ['customfield_10003', 'Epic Link']
};

// Git Integration Patterns
const gitPatterns = {
  ticketInBranch: /^(feature|bugfix)\/([A-Z]+-\d+)/,
  ticketInCommit: /\[([A-Z]+-\d+)\]/,
  ticketInPR: /([A-Z]+-\d+)/,
  targetBranch: ['main', 'master', 'develop']
};
```

### D. Task Action List UI Example

```typescript
// Sample Task Action List Response
